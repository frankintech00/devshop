# DevShoe

This is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) project with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) integrated.

DevShoe is a simple e-commerce web application built using React. The app allows users to browse a list of shoes and add them to their cart. Users can also view their cart and remove items from it. The app uses React Router to handle navigation and the context API to manage the state of the cart across different components. The app also uses custom hooks such as useTitle to set the page title dynamically.

DevShoe is built using modern web development technologies and libraries such as React, React Router, and the context API. The UI is built using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and the app uses modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals. The app also uses ES6 modules to import and export components and data.

In summary, DevShoe is a simple React e-commerce app that showcases modern web development techniques and best practices. The app provides a basic example of how to manage state using the context API, handle routing using React Router, and build a responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
